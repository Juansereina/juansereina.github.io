When starting this blog, I was inspired by other websites and realized that they all display the time it takes to read a post.

But how is it done? Here's the snippet. ðŸ˜‰

```js
function readingTime(post) {
  const WORDS_PER_MINUTE = 200;
  const regex = /\w+/g;
  const wordCount = post.match(regex)?.length || 0;

  return Math.ceil(wordCount / WORDS_PER_MINUTE);
}
```

## [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)

We create a `readingTime` function, with a `post` parameter that would be the text we want to determine the reading time for.

```js
function readingTime(post) {}
```

People read approximately between 200 and 250 words per minute, so we set a reference variable.

```js
const WORDS_PER_MINUTE = 200;
```

The trick to finding the words is to use [`Regex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

```js
const regex = /\w+/g;
```

Using the [match method](<(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)>), we identify how many words match the regex. Finally, we add the [`||`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR_assignment) operator followed by a `0` in case no matches are found.

```js
const wordCount = post.match(regex)?.length || 0;
```

We calculate the reading time by dividing the words found by the words per minute.

```js
wordCount / WORDS_PER_MINUTE;
```

Then, using [`Math.ceil()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil), we get the approximate value:

```js
function readingTime(post) {
  const WORDS_PER_MINUTE = 200;
  const regex = /\w+/g;
  const wordCount = post.match(regex)?.length || 0;

  return Math.ceil(wordCount / WORDS_PER_MINUTE);
}

const result = readingTime('Mi tiempo de lectura es de 1 min aprox.');

console.log(result); // resultado: 1
```

If you want a more approximate value, you can replace [`Math.ceil`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil) with [`Math.floor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor), [`Math.round`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round), or [`Math.trunc`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/trunc) depending on your needs.
